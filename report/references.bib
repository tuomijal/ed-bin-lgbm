   abstract = {Emergency department (ED) crowding is a significant threat to patient safety and it has been repeatedly associated with increased mortality. Forecasting future service demand has the potential to improve patient outcomes. Despite active research on the subject, proposed forecasting models have become outdated, due to the quick influx of advanced machine learning models and because the amount of multivariable input data has been limited. In this study, we document the performance of a set of advanced machine learning models in forecasting ED occupancy 24 h ahead. We use electronic health record data from a large, combined ED with an extensive set of explanatory variables, including the availability of beds in catchment area hospitals, traffic data from local observation stations, weather variables, and more. We show that DeepAR, N-BEATS, TFT, and LightGBM all outperform traditional benchmarks, with up to 15% improvement. The inclusion of the explanatory variables enhances the performance of TFT and DeepAR but fails to significantly improve the performance of LightGBM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to extensively document the superiority of machine learning over statistical benchmarks in the context of ED forecasting.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the performance of total maximum sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score and a derived measure, delta SOFA (total maximum SOFA score minus admission total SOFA) as a descriptor of multiple organ dysfunction/failure in intensive care. Design: Prospective, multicentre and multinational study. Setting: Forty intensive care units (ICUs) from Australia, Europe, North and South America. Patients: Data on 1449 patients, evaluated at admission and then consecutively every 24 h until ICU discharge (11,417 records) during May 1995. Excluded from data collection were all patients with a length of stay in the ICU less than 2 days following uncomplicated scheduled surgery. Main outcome measure: Survival status at ICU discharge. Interventions: The collection of raw data necessary for the computation of a SOFA score on admission and then every 24 h, and basic demographic and clinical statistics. Measurements and main results: Mean total maximum SOFA score presented a very good correlation to ICU outcome, with mortality rates ranging from 3.2% in patients without organ failure to 91.3% in patients with failure of all the six organs analysed. A maximum score was reached 1.1 ± 0.2 days after admission for all the organ systems analysed. The total maximum SOFA score presented an area under the ROC curve of 0.847 (SE 0.012), which was significantly higher than any of its individual components. The cardiovascular score (odds ratio 1.68) was associated with the highest relative contribution to outcome. No independent contribution could be demonstrated for the hepatic score. No significant interactions were found. Principal components analysis demonstrated the existence of a two-factor structure that became clearer when analysis was limited to the presence or absence of organ failure (SOFA score ≥ 3 points) during the ICU stay. The first factor comprises respiratory, cardiovascular and neurological systems and the second coagulation, hepatic and renal systems. Delta SOFA also presented a good correlation to outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.742 (SE 0.017) for delta SOFA, lower than the total maximum SOFA score or admission total SOFA score. The impact of delta SOFA on prognosis remained significant after correction for admission total SOFA. Conclusions: The results show that total maximum SOFA score and delta SOFA can be used to quantify the degree of dysfunction/failure already present on ICU admission, the degree of dysfunction/failure that appears during the ICU stay and the cumulative insult suffered by the patient. These properties make it a good instrument to be used in the evaluation of organ dysfunction/failure.},

First measured vital sign datasets on general wards were prospectively collected using a mobile solution system during routine patient care. Area under receiver operator characteristic curves were constructed, and comparisons between ROC curves were conducted with Delong{\textquoteright}s test for two correlated ROC curves.Setting One university hospital and two regional hospitals in Finland.Participants All 19 001 adult patients admitted to 45 general wards in the three hospitals over the 1-year study period. After excluding 102/19 001 patients (0.53\%) with data on some vital signs missing, the final cohort consisted of 18 889 patients with full datasets.Primary and secondary outcome measures The primary outcome measure was 1-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 2-day and 30-day mortality rates.Results Patients{\textquoteright} median age was 70 years, 51\% were male and 31\% had a surgical reason for admission. The 1-day mortality was 0.36\% and the 30-day mortality was 3.9\%. The NEWS discriminated 1-day non-survivors with excellent accuracy (AUROC 0.91, 95\% CI 0.87 to 0.95) and 30-day mortality with acceptable accuracy (0.75, 95\% CI 0.73 to 0.77). The NEWS{\textquoteright}s respiratory rate component discriminated 1-day non-survivors better (0.78, 95\% CI 0.72 to 0.84) as compared with the oxygen saturation (0.66, 95\% CI 0.59 to 0.73), systolic blood pressure (0.65, 95\% CI 0.59 to 0.72) and heart rate (0.67, 95\% CI 0.61 to 0.74) subcomponents (p\&lt;0.01 in all ROC comparisons). As with the total NEWS, the discriminative performance of the individual score components decreased substantially for the 30-day mortality.Conclusions NEWS discriminated general ward patients at risk for acute death with excellent statistical accuracy. The respiratory rate component is especially strongly associated with short-term mortality.Trial registration number NCT04055350.Data are available on reasonable request.

@article{Bernstein2003,
abstract = {Objectives: To develop a quantitative measure of emergency department (ED) crowding and busyness. Methods: A five-week study in spring 2002 in an urban teaching ED compared a new index (the Emergency Department Work Index [EDWIN]) with attending physician and nurse ratings of crowding. EDWIN is defined as ∑niti/Na(BT - BA), where ni = number of patients in the ED in triage category i, t i = triage category, Na = number of attending physicians on duty, BT = number of treatment bays, and BA = number of admitted patients in the ED. The triage system used is the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), which was modified by reversing the ranking of triage categories; that is, an ESI score of 1 represented the least acute patient and 5 the sickest. EDWIN was calculated every two hours in a convenience sample of 60 eight-hour shifts. With each measurement, the charge attending physician and nurse estimated how busy/crowded the ED was, using a Likert scale. Nurse and physician assessments were averaged and compared with EDWIN scores. Data were analyzed with SPSS 10.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Results: A total of 2,647 patients aged 18 years and older were assessed at 225 time points over 35 consecutive days. Nurses and physicians showed good interrater agreement of crowding assessment (weighted $\kappa$ 0.61, 95% confidence interval = 0.53 to 0.69). Median EDWIN scores and interquartile ranges (IQRs) when the ED was rated as not busy, average, and very busy were 1.07 (IQR = 0.80 to 1.55), 1.55 (IQR = 1.16 to 1.93), and 1.83 (IQR = 1.42 to 2.45) (p < 0.001). The ED was on diversion for 17 time blocks (6.5% of all blocks), with a median EDWIN of 2.77 (IQR = 1.83 to 3.63), compared with an EDWIN of 1.45 (IQR = 1.05 to 2.00) when not on diversion (p < 0.001). EDWIN scores correlated weakly with various process-of-care measures chosen as secondary end points. Conclusions: EDWIN correlated well with staff assessment of ED crowding and diversion. The index can be programmed into tracking software for use as a " dashboard" to alert staff when the ED is approaching crisis. If validated across other sites, EDWIN may provide a tool to compare crowding levels among different EDs.},

@article{Weiss2004,
abstract = {Objectives: No single universal definition of emergency department (ED) overcrowding exists. The authors hypothesize that a previously developed site-sampling form for academic ED overcrowding is a valid model to quantify overcrowding in academic institutions and can be used to develop a validated short form that correlates with overcrowding. Methods: A 23-question site-sampling form was designed based on input from academic physicians at eight medical schools representative of academic EDs nationwide. A total of 336 site-samplings at eight academic medical centers were conducted at 42 computer-generated random times over a three-week period by independent observers at each site. These sampling times ranged from very slow to severely overcrowded. The outcome variable was the degree of overcrowding as assessed by the charge nurse and ED physicians. The full model consisted of objective data that were obtained by counting the number of patients, determining patients' waiting times, and obtaining information from registration, triage, and ancillary services. Specific objective data were indexed to site-specific demographics. The outcome and objective data were compared using a multiple linear regression to determine predictive validity of the full model. A five-question reduced model was calculated using a backward stepdown procedure. Predictive validity and relationships between the outcome and objective data were assessed using a mixed-effects linear regression model, treating center as random effect. Results: Overcrowding occurred 12% to 73% of the time (mean, 35%), with two hospitals being overcrowded more than 50% of the time. Comparison of objective and outcome data resulted in an R2 of 0.49 (p < 0.001), indicating a good degree of predictive validity. A reduced five-question model predicted the full model with 88% accuracy. Conclusions: Overcrowding varied widely between academic centers during the study period. Results of a five-question reduced model are valid and accurate in predicting the degree of overcrowding in academic centers.},

@article{Gneiting2007,
abstract = {Scoring rules assess the quality of probabilistic forecasts, by assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an observation drawn from the distribution F if he or she issues the probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ≠ F. It is strictly proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions, and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables, we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation. Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical, pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel representation in terms of negative definite functions, with links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively appealing interval score as a utility function in interval estimation that addresses width as well as coverage. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Statistical Association.},

abstract = {Study objective: To develop a discrete event simulation of emergency department (ED) patient flow for the purpose of forecasting near-future operating conditions and to validate the forecasts with several measures of ED crowding. Methods: We developed a discrete event simulation of patient flow with evidence from the literature. Development was purely theoretical, whereas validation involved patient data from an academic ED. The model inputs and outputs, respectively, are 6-variable descriptions of every present and future patient in the ED. We validated the model by using a sliding-window design, ensuring separation of fitting and validation data in time series. We sampled consecutive 10-minute observations during 2006 (n=52,560). The outcome measures-all forecast 2, 4, 6, and 8 hours into the future from each observation-were the waiting count, waiting time, occupancy level, length of stay, boarding count, boarding time, and ambulance diversion. Forecasting performance was assessed with Pearson's correlation, residual summary statistics, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results: The correlations between crowding forecasts and actual outcomes started high and decreased gradually up to 8 hours into the future (lowest Pearson's r for waiting count=0.56; waiting time=0.49; occupancy level=0.78; length of stay=0.86; boarding count=0.79; boarding time=0.80). The residual means were unbiased for all outcomes except the boarding time. The discriminatory power for ambulance diversion remained consistently high up to 8 hours into the future (lowest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.86). Conclusion: By modeling patient flow, rather than operational summary variables, our simulation forecasts several measures of near-future ED crowding, with various degrees of good performance. {\textcopyright} 2008 American College of Emergency Physicians.},

@article{Bergstra2011,
abstract = {Several recent advances to the state of the art in image classification benchmarks have come from better configurations of existing techniques rather than novel approaches to feature learning. Traditionally, hyper-parameter optimization has been the job of humans because they can be very efficient in regimes where only a few trials are possible. Presently, computer clusters and GPU processors make it possible to run more trials and we show that algorithmic approaches can find better results. We present hyper-parameter optimization results on tasks of training neural networks and deep belief networks (DBNs). We optimize hyper-parameters using random search and two new greedy sequential methods based on the expected improvement criterion. Random search has been shown to be sufficiently efficient for learning neural networks for several datasets, but we show it is unreliable for training DBNs. The sequential algorithms are applied to the most difficult DBN learning problems from [1] and find significantly better results than the best previously reported. This work contributes novel techniques for making response surface models P(y|x) in which many elements of hyper-parameter assignment (x) are known to be irrelevant given particular values of other elements.},

abstract = {Emergency departments (EDs) provide medical treatment for a broad spectrum of illnesses and injuries to patients who arrive at all hours of the day. The quality and efficient delivery of health care in EDs are associated with a number of factors, such as patient overall length of stay (LOS) and admission, prompt ambulance diversion, quick and accurate triage, nurse and physician assessment, diagnostic and laboratory services, consultations and treatment. One of the most important ways to plan the healthcare delivery efficiently is to make forecasts of ED processes. The aim this study is thus to provide an exhaustive review for ED stakeholders interested in applying forecasting methods to their ED processes. A categorisation, analysis and interpretation of 102 papers is performed for review. This exhaustive review provides an insight for researchers and practitioners about forecasting in EDs in terms of showing current state and potential areas for future attempts.},

One of the commentaries noted that the results had not been tested for statistical significance. This paper undertakes such an analysis by examining the primary findings of that competition. We introduce a new methodology that has not previously been used to evaluate economic forecasts: multiple comparisons. We use this technique to compare each method against the best and against the mean. We conclude that the accuracy of the various methods does differ significantly, and that some methods are significantly better than others. We confirm that there is no relationship between complexity and accuracy but also show that there is a significant relationship among the various measures of accuracy. Finally, we find that the M3 conclusion that a combination of methods is better than that of the methods being combined was not proven. {\textcopyright} 2004 International Institute of Forecasters.

@article{Trotzky2021,
abstract = {ABSTRACT: Overcrowding in the emergency departments (ED) is a significant issue associated with increased morbidity and mortality rates as well as decreased patient satisfaction. Length of stay (LOS) is both a cause and a result of overcrowding. In Israel, as there are few emergency medicine (EM) physicians, the ED team is supplemented with doctors from specialties including internal medicine, general surgery, orthopedics etc. Here we compare ED length of stay (ED-LOS), treatment time and decision time between EM physicians, internists and general surgeons.A retrospective cohort study was conducted examining the Emergency Department length of stay (ED-LOS) for all adult patients attending Sheba Medical Center ED, Israel, between January 1st, and December 31st, 2014. Using electronic medical records, data was gathered on patient age, sex, primary ED physician, diagnosis, eventual disposition, treatment time and disposition decision time. The primary outcome variable was ED-LOS relative to case physician specialty and level (ED, internal medicine or surgery; specialist or resident). Secondary analysis was conducted on time to treatment/ decision as well as ED-LOS relative to patient classification variables (internal medicine vs surgical diagnosis). Specialists were compared to specialists and residents to residents for all outcomes.Residents and specialists in either EM, internal medicine or general surgery attended 57,486 (51.50%) of 111,630 visits to Sheba Hospital's general ED. Mean ED-LOS was 4.12 ± 3.18 hours. Mean treatment time and decision time were 1.79 ± 1.82 hours, 2.84 ± 2.17 hours respectively. Amongst specialists, ED-LOS was shorter for EM physicians than for internal medicine physicians (mean difference 0.28 hours, 95% CI 0.14-0.43) and general surgeons (mean difference 0.63 hours, 95% CI 0.43-0.83). There was no statistical significance between residents when comparing outcomes.Increasing the number of EM specialists in the ED may support efforts to decrease ED-LOS, overcrowding and medical errors whilst increasing patient satisfaction and outcomes.},

Data were collected on patients managed before (n=200) and after (n=160) the addition of a second physician on the shift. Results: The addition of a physician in the busy evening shift decreased the length of stay from 176±137 to 141±86 min (mean±SD, P=0.012) for outpatients discharged after evaluation and management in the emergency department. The length of stay for emergency department inpatients admitted for hospitalization was not significantly reduced.

@article{McCarthy2009,
abstract = {Study objective: We determine the effect of crowding on emergency department (ED) waiting room, treatment, and boarding times across multiple sites and acuity groups. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study that included ED visit and inpatient medicine occupancy data for a 1-year period at 4 EDs. We measured crowding at 30-minute intervals throughout each patient's ED stay. We estimated the effect of crowding on waiting room time, treatment time, and boarding time separately, using discrete-time survival analysis with time-dependent crowding measures (ie, number waiting, number being treated, number boarding, and inpatient medicine occupancy rate), controlling for patient demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Crowding substantially delayed patients' waiting room and boarding times but not treatment time. During the day shift, when the number boarding increased from the 50th to the 90th percentile, the adjusted median waiting room time (range 26 to 70 minutes) increased by 6% to 78% (range 33 to 82 minutes), and the adjusted median boarding time (range 250 to 626 minutes) increased by 15% to 47% (range 288 to 921 minutes), depending on the site. Crowding delayed the care of high-acuity level 2 patients at all sites. During crowded periods (ie, 90%), the adjusted median waiting room times of high-acuity level 2 patients were 3% to 35% higher than during normal periods, depending on the site and crowding measure. Conclusion: Using discrete-time survival analysis, we were able to dynamically measure crowding throughout each patient's ED visit and demonstrate its deleterious effect on the timeliness of emergency care, even for high-acuity patients. {\textcopyright} 2009 American College of Emergency Physicians.},

@article{Eriksson2018,
abstract = {Aims and objectives: To explore registered nurses' perceptions of safe practice in care for patients with an extended length of stay in the emergency department. Background: Extended length of stay and overcrowding in emergency departments are described internationally as one of the most comprehensive challenges of modern emergency care. An emergency department is not designed, equipped or staffed to provide care for prolonged periods of time. This context, combined with a high workload, poses a risk to patient safety, with additional medical errors and an increased number of adverse events. From this perspective, it is important to extend our knowledge and to describe registered nurses' experiences of safe practice. Design: A qualitative, inductive and descriptive study. Methods: Qualitative interview study carried out in five emergency departments. Data were analysed using a qualitative content analysis with a latent approach. Results: Patient safety meets obstacles in the clinical environment involving experiencing deficiencies regarding patient safety in the clinical setting and the impact of working procedures and routines. Moreover, nurses are challenged in their professional responsibilities involving balancing essential nursing care and actual workload; it is common to experience emotional reactions based on feelings of loss of control. Conclusions: From the nurses' perspective, a prolonged stay in the emergency department may lead to negative consequences for both patient safety and care as well as registered nurses' psychosocial experiences. An extended length of stay significantly reduces the level of nursing and caring that registered nurses can perform in the emergency department. Relevance to clinical practice: This study indicates that emergency departments should review their procedures to avoid both deviations from normal practice and moral stress among registered nurses. This can contribute to an increased understanding and insight about the challenge of patient safety in an emergency department setting.},

In this study, we aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of these two rules; we also compared the diagnostic accuracy between them. We searched PubMed and Web of science up to April 2015. Studies assessed Wells score and revised Geneva score for diagnosis suspected PE were included. The summary area under the curve (AUC) and the 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Eleven studies were included in this meta-analysis. For Wells score, the sensitivity ranged from 63.8 to 79.3 %, and the specificity ranged from 48.8 to 90.0 %. The overall weighted AUC was 0.778 (95 % CI 0.740–0.818; Z = 9.88, P < 0.001). For revised Geneva score, the sensitivity ranged from 55.3 to 73.6 %. The overall weighted AUC was 0.693 (95 % CI 0.653–0.736; Z = 11.96, P < 0.001). 95 % CIs of two AUCs were not overlapped, which indicated Wells score was more accurate than revised Geneva score for predicting PE in suspected patients. Meta-regression showed diagnostic accuracy of these two rules was not related with PE prevalence. Sensitivity analysis by only included prospective studies showed the results were robust. Our results showed the Wells score was more effective than the revised Geneva score in discriminate PE in suspected patients.},

@article{Jiang2018,
abstract = {Background and objective The Accident and Emergency Department (A&ED) is the frontline for providing emergency care in hospitals. Unfortunately, relative A&ED resources have failed to keep up with continuously increasing demand in recent years, which leads to overcrowding in A&ED. Knowing the fluctuation of patient arrival volume in advance is a significant premise to relieve this pressure. Based on this motivation, the objective of this study is to explore an integrated framework with high accuracy for predicting A&ED patient flow under different triage levels, by combining a novel feature selection process with deep neural networks. Methods Administrative data is collected from an actual A&ED and categorized into five groups based on different triage levels. A genetic algorithm (GA)-based feature selection algorithm is improved and implemented as a pre-processing step for this time-series prediction problem, in order to explore key features affecting patient flow. In our improved GA, a fitness-based crossover is proposed to maintain the joint information of multiple features during iterative process, instead of traditional point-based crossover. Deep neural networks (DNN) is employed as the prediction model to utilize their universal adaptability and high flexibility. In the model-training process, the learning algorithm is well-configured based on a parallel stochastic gradient descent algorithm. Two effective regularization strategies are integrated in one DNN framework to avoid overfitting. All introduced hyper-parameters are optimized efficiently by grid-search in one pass. Results As for feature selection, our improved GA-based feature selection algorithm has outperformed a typical GA and four state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms (mRMR, SAFS, VIFR, and CFR). As for the prediction accuracy of proposed integrated framework, compared with other frequently used statistical models (GLM, seasonal-ARIMA, ARIMAX, and ANN) and modern machine models (SVM-RBF, SVM-linear, RF, and R-LASSO), the proposed integrated “DNN-I-GA” framework achieves higher prediction accuracy on both MAPE and RMSE metrics in pairwise comparisons. Conclusions The contribution of our study is two-fold. Theoretically, the traditional GA-based feature selection process is improved to have less hyper-parameters and higher efficiency, and the joint information of multiple features is maintained by fitness-based crossover operator. The universal property of DNN is further enhanced by merging different regularization strategies. Practically, features selected by our improved GA can be used to acquire an underlying relationship between patient flows and input features. Predictive values are significant indicators of patients' demand and can be used by A&ED managers to make resource planning and allocation. High accuracy achieved by the present framework in different cases enhances the reliability of downstream decision makings.},

@article{Oreshkin2019,
abstract = {We focus on solving the univariate times series point forecasting problem using deep learning. We propose a deep neural architecture based on backward and forward residual links and a very deep stack of fully-connected layers. The architecture has a number of desirable properties, being interpretable, applicable without modification to a wide array of target domains, and fast to train. We test the proposed architecture on several well-known datasets, including M3, M4 and TOURISM competition datasets containing time series from diverse domains. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for two configurations of N-BEATS for all the datasets, improving forecast accuracy by 11% over a statistical benchmark and by 3% over last year's winner of the M4 competition, a domain-adjusted hand-crafted hybrid between neural network and statistical time series models. The first configuration of our model does not employ any time-series-specific components and its performance on heterogeneous datasets strongly suggests that, contrarily to received wisdom, deep learning primitives such as residual blocks are by themselves sufficient to solve a wide range of forecasting problems. Finally, we demonstrate how the proposed architecture can be augmented to provide outputs that are interpretable without considerable loss in accuracy.},

@article{Pirneskoski2020,
abstract = {Aim of the study: The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is a validated method for predicting clinical deterioration in hospital wards, but its performance in prehospital settings remains controversial. Modern machine learning models may outperform traditional statistical analyses for predicting short-term mortality. Thus, we aimed to compare the mortality prediction accuracy of NEWS and random forest machine learning using prehospital vital signs. Methods: In this retrospective study, all electronic ambulance mission reports between 2008 and 2015 in a single EMS system were collected. Adult patients (≥ 18 years) were included in the analysis. Random forest models with and without blood glucose were compared to the traditional NEWS for predicting one-day mortality. A ten-fold cross-validation method was applied to train and validate the random forest models. Results: A total of 26,458 patients were included in the study of whom 278 (1.0%) died within one day of ambulance mission. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for one-day mortality was 0.836 (95% CI, 0.810−0.860) for NEWS, 0.858 (95% CI, 0.832−0.883) for a random forest trained with NEWS variables only and 0.868 (0.843−0.892) for a random forest trained with NEWS variables and blood glucose. Conclusion: A random forest algorithm trained with NEWS variables was superior to traditional NEWS for predicting one-day mortality in adult prehospital patients, although the risk of selection bias must be acknowledged. The inclusion of blood glucose in the model further improved its predictive performance.},

Design: Retrospective analysis of 62 495 probabilistically linked emergency hospital admissions and death records. Setting: Three tertiary metropolitan hospitals between July 2000 and June 2003. Participants: All patients 18 years or older whose first ED attendance resulted in hospital admission during the study period. Main outcome measures: Deaths on days 2, 7 and 30 were evaluated against an Overcrowding Hazard Scale based on hospital and ED occupancy, after adjusting for age, diagnosis, referral source, urgency and mode of transport to hospital. Results: There was a linear relationship between the Overcrowding Hazard Scale and deaths on Day 7 (r=0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.00). An Overcrowding Hazard Scale >2 was associated with an increased Day 2, Day 7 and Day 30 hazard ratio for death of 1.3 (95% CI, 1.1–1.6), 1.3 (95% CI, 1.2–1.5) and 1.2 (95% CI, 1.1–1.3), respectively. Deaths at 30 days associated with an Overcrowding Hazard Scale >2 compared with one of <3 were undifferentiated with respect to age, diagnosis, urgency, transport mode, referral source or hospital length of stay, but had longer ED durations of stay (risk ratio per hour of ED stay, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1–1.1; P<0.001) and longer physician waiting times (risk ratio per hour of ED wait, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.1–1.3; P=0.01). Conclusions: Hospital and ED overcrowding is associated with increased mortality. The Overcrowding Hazard Scale may be used to assess the hazard associated with hospital and ED overcrowding. Reducing overcrowding may improve outcomes for patients requiring emergency hospital admission. METHODS},

@article{Guttmann2011,
abstract = {Objective: To determine whether patients who are not admitted to hospital after attending an emergency department during shifts with long waiting times are at risk for adverse events. Design: Population based retrospective cohort study using health administrative databases. Setting: High volume emergency departments in Ontario, Canada, fiscal years 2003-7. Participants: All emergency department patients who were not admitted (seen and discharged; left without being seen). Outcome measures: Risk of adverse events (admission to hospital or death within seven days) adjusted for important characteristics of patients, shift, and hospital. Results: 13 934 542 patients were seen and discharged and 617 011 left without being seen. The risk of adverse events increased with the mean length of stay of similar patients in the same shift in the emergency department. For mean length of stay ≥6 v <1 hour the adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) was 1.79 (1.24 to 2.59) for death and 1.95 (1.79 to 2.13) for admission in high acuity patients and 1.71 (1.25 to 2.35) for death and 1.66 (1.56 to 1.76) for admission in low acuity patients). Leaving without being seen was not associated with an increase in adverse events at the level of the patient or by annual rates of the hospital. Conclusions: Presenting to an emergency department during shifts with longer waiting times, reflected in longer mean length of stay, is associated with a greater risk in the short term of death and admission to hospital in patients who are well enough to leave the department. Patients who leave without being seen are not at higher risk of short term adverse events.},

@article{Zhou2018,
abstract = {Background: Hospital crowding is a rising problem, effective predicting and detecting managment can helpful to reduce crowding. Our team has successfully proposed a hybrid model combining both the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and the nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARNN) models in the schistosomiasis and hand, foot, and mouth disease forecasting study. In this paper, our aim is to explore the application of the hybrid ARIMA-NARNN model to track the trends of the new admission inpatients, which provides a methodological basis for reducing crowding. Methods: We used the single seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), NARNN and the hybrid SARIMA-NARNN model to fit and forecast the monthly and daily number of new admission inpatients. The root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to compare the forecasting performance among the three models. The modeling time range of monthly data included was from January 2010 to June 2016, July to October 2016 as the corresponding testing data set. The daily modeling data set was from January 4 to September 4, 2016, while the testing time range included was from September 5 to October 2, 2016. Results: For the monthly data, the modeling RMSE and the testing RMSE, MAE and MAPE of SARIMA-NARNN model were less than those obtained from the single SARIMA or NARNN model, but the MAE and MAPE of modeling performance of SARIMA-NARNN model did not improve. For the daily data, all RMSE, MAE and MAPE of NARNN model were the lowest both in modeling stage and testing stage. Conclusions: Hybrid model does not necessarily outperform its constituents' performances. It is worth attempting to explore the reliable model to forecast the number of new admission inpatients from different data.},

abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization iti function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitives highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

@article{Shangchen2020,
abstract = {Algorithms that are previously difficult to implement have been successfully applied in different fields because of hardware development. Quantitative investment has the characteristics of rationality and efficiency and has obvious advantages over traditional methods. Based on the SP500 index data for 4936 trading days, 10 characteristics such as PSY, MACD, STOCHK and STOCHD were generated. Based on those features, quantitative investment strategies for the GBDT and LightGBM models were constructed. Validation showed that the annualized returns of the two strategies exceeded the direct purchase and holding of the SP500 index, with the annualized returns of 43.4% and 50.7%. The performance of risk control of the two models was also better than the benchmark strategy. The GBDT model had less risk than the LightGBM model when the same benefits were obtained. The accuracy of the LightGBM model was higher than that of the GBDT, and its F1 score was 0.814, while the GBDT model was 0.805. For the different selected components, the results of the principal component analysis showed that the PSY feature weight in the GBDT model was much higher than other features, and a single feature can be applied for straightforward prediction. In the LightGBM model, the seven feature weights such as STOCHK were relatively balanced, and more features can be balanced at the same time to obtain more accurate results. The article designs investment strategies based on the LightGBM model for the first time and provides new ideas for providing a framework for index investment.},

@article{Eidsto2023,
abstract = {The current evidence suggests that higher levels of crowding in the Emergency Department (ED) have a negative impact on patient outcomes, including mortality. However, only limited data are available about the association between crowding and mortality, especially for patients discharged from the ED. The primary objective of this study was to establish the association between ED crowding and overall 10-day mortality for non-critical patients. The secondary objective was to perform a subgroup analysis of mortality risk separately for both admitted and discharged patients. An observational single-centre retrospective study was conducted in the Tampere University Hospital ED from January 2018 to February 2020. The ED Occupancy Ratio (EDOR) was used to describe the level of crowding and it was calculated both at patient's arrival and at the maximum point during the stay in the ED. Age, gender, Emergency Medical Service transport, triage acuity, and shift were considered as confounding factors in the analyses. A total of 103,196 ED visits were included. The overall 10-day mortality rate was 1.0% (n = 1022). After controlling for confounding factors, the highest quartile of crowding was identified as an independent risk factor for 10-day mortality. The results were essentially similar whether using the EDOR at arrival (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.07–1.61, p = 0.009) or the maximum EDOR (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.04–1.56, p = 0.020). A more precise, mortality-associated threshold of crowding was identified at EDOR 0.9. The subgroup analysis did not yield any statistically significant findings. The risk for 10-day mortality increased among non-critical ED patients treated during the highest EDOR quartile.},

@article{Lundberg2017,
abstract = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties. The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous approaches.},

However, there is a lack in effective external overall predictors, particularly those representing public activity. Objectives: This study, therefore, examines public activity measured by regional road traffic flow as an external predictor of ED crowding in an urban hospital. Methods: Seasonal autoregressive cross-validated models (SARIMA) were compared with respect to their forecasting error on ED crowding data. Results: It could be shown that inclusion of inflowing road traffic into a SARIMA model effectively improved prediction errors. Conclusion: The results provide evidence that circadian patterns of medical emergencies are connected to human activity levels in the region and could be captured by public monitoring of traffic flow. In order to corroborate this model, data from further years and additional regions need to be considered. It would also be interesting to study public activity by additional variables.},

Methods: This research study utilized tools that identified overcrowding to establish a reliable two-hour forecasting tool within the Emergency Department. It included the use of the Dixon Forecasting Model (DFM), BR, and the NEDOCS. A combination of two tools, the DFM and BR, was utilized to forecast overcrowding based on current census. This two-hour forecast was validated by the NEDOCS and BR, which have been acknowledged in the identification of real-time overcrowding (Jones, 2006). Data Analysis: The two-hour forecasted BR is moderately correlated with the NEDOCS and BR at the forecasted time. This is evidenced by a correlation coefficient of 0.508 with the NEDOCS and a correlation coefficient of 0.492 with the BR. Further data analysis revealed a strong correlation between the NEDOCS and the BR, as evidenced by a correlation coefficient of 0.949.},

We present a deep learning framework to predict patient flow rates in EDs, namely the rates of arrival, treatment, and discharge for patients across all triage levels. Our model detects short-term and long-term temporal dependencies within the time-series data of a given patient-flow variable, as well as dependencies between time-series data of different patient-flow variables. We implement this framework as a convolutional neural network, which we call PatientFlowNet. Our proposed model learns simultaneously from multiple flow variables over a long temporal window and predicts future values of arrival, treatment, and discharge rates in the ED. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art methods on data from EDs in three different hospitals. Results show that PatientFlowNet achieves superior prediction accuracy, compared to the baseline methods, and yields a mean absolute error that is 4.8% lower than the leading baseline. Furthermore, we provide a visual and interpretable representation of the learned dependencies by our model, between patient-flow variables in EDs.},

@article{Ke2017,
abstract = {Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB LightGBM. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.},

abstract = {Multi-horizon forecasting often contains a complex mix of inputs – including static (i.e. time-invariant) covariates, known future inputs, and other exogenous time series that are only observed in the past – without any prior information on how they interact with the target. Several deep learning methods have been proposed, but they are typically ‘black-box' models that do not shed light on how they use the full range of inputs present in practical scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) – a novel attention-based architecture that combines high-performance multi-horizon forecasting with interpretable insights into temporal dynamics. To learn temporal relationships at different scales, TFT uses recurrent layers for local processing and interpretable self-attention layers for long-term dependencies. TFT utilizes specialized components to select relevant features and a series of gating layers to suppress unnecessary components, enabling high performance in a wide range of scenarios. On a variety of real-world datasets, we demonstrate significant performance improvements over existing benchmarks, and highlight three practical interpretability use cases of TFT.},

In retail businesses, for example, probabilistic demand forecasts are crucial for having the right inventory available at the right time and in the right place. This paper proposes DeepAR, a methodology for producing accurate probabilistic forecasts, based on training an autoregressive recurrent neural network model on a large number of related time series. We demonstrate how the application of deep learning techniques to forecasting can overcome many of the challenges that are faced by widely-used classical approaches to the problem. By means of extensive empirical evaluations on several real-world forecasting datasets, we show that our methodology produces more accurate forecasts than other state-of-the-art methods, while requiring minimal manual work.},

Despite widespread recognition of the problem, the research and policy agendas needed to understand and address ED crowding are just beginning to unfold. We present a conceptual model of ED crowding to help researchers, administrators, and policymakers understand its causes and develop potential solutions. The conceptual model partitions ED crowding into 3 interdependent components: input, throughput, and output. These components exist within an acute care system that is characterized by the delivery of unscheduled care. The goal of the conceptual model is to provide a practical framework on which an organized research, policy, and operations management agenda can be based to alleviate ED crowding.},

@article{Morley2018,
abstract = {Background Emergency department crowding is a major global healthcare issue. There is much debate as to the causes of the phenomenon, leading to difficulties in developing successful, targeted solutions. Aim The aim of this systematic review was to critically analyse and summarise the findings of peer-reviewed research studies investigating the causes and consequences of, and solutions to, emergency department crowding. Method The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. A structured search of four databases (Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and Web of Science) was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed research publications aimed at investigating the causes or consequences of, or solutions to, emergency department crowding, published between January 2000 and June 2018. Two reviewers used validated critical appraisal tools to independently assess the quality of the studies. The study protocol was registered with the International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2017: CRD42017073439). Results From 4,131 identified studies and 162 full text reviews, 102 studies met the inclusion criteria. The majority were retrospective cohort studies, with the greatest proportion (51%) trialling or modelling potential solutions to emergency department crowding. Fourteen studies examined causes and 40 investigated consequences. Two studies looked at both causes and consequences, and two investigated causes and solutions. Conclusions The negative consequences of ED crowding are well established, including poorer patient outcomes and the inability of staff to adhere to guideline-recommended treatment. This review identified a mismatch between causes and solutions. The majority of identified causes related to the number and type of people attending ED and timely discharge from ED, while reported solutions focused on efficient patient flow within the ED. Solutions aimed at the introduction of whole-of-system initiatives to meet timed patient disposition targets, as well as extended hours of primary care, demonstrated promising outcomes. While the review identified increased presentations by the elderly with complex and chronic conditions as an emerging and widespread driver of crowding, more research is required to isolate the precise local factors leading to ED crowding, with system-wide solutions tailored to address identified causes.},

@article{Richardson2006,
abstract = {Objective: To quantify any relationship between emergency department (ED) overcrowding and 10-day patient mortality. Design and setting: Retrospective stratified cohort analysis of three 48-week periods in a tertiary mixed ED in 2002-2004. Mean "occupancy" (a measure of overcrowding based on number of patients receiving treatment) was calculated for 8-hour shifts and for 12-week periods. The shifts of each type in the highest quartile of occupancy were classified as overcrowded. Participants: All presentations of patients (except those arriving by interstate ambulance) during "overcrowded" (OC) shifts and during an equivalent number of "not overcrowded" (NOC) shifts (same shift, weekday and period). Main outcome measure: In-hospital death of a patient recorded within 10 days of the most recent ED presentation. Results: There were 34 377 OC and 32 231 NOC presentations (736 shifts each); the presenting patients were well matched for age and sex. Mean occupancy was 21.6 on OC shifts and 16.4 on NOC shifts. There were 144 deaths in the OC cohort and 101 in the NOC cohort (0.42% and 0.31%, respectively; P = 0.025). The relative risk of death at 10 days was 1.34 (95% CI, 1.04-1.72). Subgroup analysis showed that, in the OC cohort, there were more presentations in more urgent triage categories, decreased treatment performance by standard measures, and a higher mortality rate by triage category. Conclusions: In this hospital, presentation during high ED occupancy was associated with increased in-hospital mortality at 10 days, after controlling for seasonal, shift, and day of the week effects. The magnitude of the effect is about 13 deaths per year. Further studies are warranted.},

@article{Harrou2020,
abstract = {As the demand for medical cares has considerably expanded, the issue of managing patient flow in hospitals and especially in emergency departments (EDs) is certainly a key issue to be carefully mitigated. This can lead to overcrowding and the degradation of the quality of the provided medical services. Thus, the accurate modeling and forecasting of ED visits are critical for efficiently managing the overcrowding problems and enable appropriate optimization of the available resources. This paper proposed an effective method to forecast daily and hourly visits at an ED using Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) algorithm. Indeed, the VAE model as a deep learning-based model has gained special attention in features extraction and modeling due to its distribution-free assumptions and superior nonlinear approximation. Two types of forecasting were conducted: one- and multi-step-ahead forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the VAE is investigated to improve forecasting of patient arrivals time-series data. Data sets from the pediatric emergency department at Lille regional hospital center, France, are employed to evaluate the forecasting performance of the introduced method. The VAE model was evaluated and compared with seven methods namely Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Convolutional LSTM Network (ConvLSTM), restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), Gated recurrent units (GRUs), and convolutional neural network (CNN). The results clearly show the promising performance of these deep learning models in forecasting ED visits and emphasize the better performance of the VAE in comparison to the other models.},

@article{Berg2019,
abstract = {Study objective: We describe the association between emergency department (ED) crowding and 10-day mortality for patients triaged to lower acuity levels at ED arrival and without need of acute hospital care on ED departure. Methods: This was a registry study based on ED visits with all patients aged 18 years or older, with triage acuity levels 3 to 5, and without need of acute hospital care on ED departure during 2009 to 2016 (n=705,699). The sample was divided into patients surviving (n=705,076) or dying (n=623) within 10 days. Variables concerning patient characteristics and measures of ED crowding (mean length of stay and ED occupancy ratio) were extracted from the hospital's electronic health records. ED length of stay per ED visit was estimated by the average length of stay for all patients who presented to the ED during the same day and shift and with the same acuity level. The 10-day mortality after ED discharge was used as the outcome measure. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: The 10-day mortality rate was 0.09% (n=623). The event group had larger proportions of patients aged 80 years or older (51.4% versus 7.7%) and triaged with acuity level 3 (63.3% versus 35.6%), and greater comorbidity (age-combined Charlson comorbidity index median interquartile range 6 versus 0). We observed an increased 10-day mortality for patients with a mean ED length of stay greater than or equal to 8 hours versus less than 2 hours (adjusted odds ratio 5.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.15 to 15.94) and for elevated ED occupancy ratio. Adjusted odds ratios for ED occupancy ratio quartiles 2, 3, and 4 versus quartile 1 were 1.48 (95% CI 1.14 to 1.92), 1.63 (95% CI 1.24 to 2.14), and 1.53 (95% CI 1.15 to 2.03), respectively. Conclusion: Patients assigned to lower triage acuity levels when arriving to the ED and without need of acute hospital care on departure from the ED had higher 10-day mortality when the mean ED length of stay exceeded 8 hours and when ED occupancy ratio increased.},

@article{Jo2014,
abstract = {Background To measure emergency department (ED) crowding, the emergency department occupancy ratio (EDOR) was introduced. Objective Our aim was to determine whether the EDOR is associated with mortality in adult patients who visited the study hospital ED. Methods We reviewed data on all patients who visited the ED of an urban tertiary academic hospital in Korea for 2 consecutive years. The EDOR is defined by the total number of patients in the ED divided by the number of licensed ED beds. We tested the association between the EDOR (quartile) and each outcome using a multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for potential confounders: age, sex, emergency medical services transport, transferred case, weekend visit, shift, triage acuity, visit cause of injury, operation, vital signs, intensive care unit or ward admission, and ED length of stay (quartile). The main outcome measures were survival status at discharge and at 1-7 days. Results A total of 54,410 adult patients were enrolled. The EDOR ranged from 0.41 to 2.31 and the median was 1.24. On multivariable analyses, in comparison with the lowest (first) quartile, the highest (fourth) quartile of the EDOR was associated with 1-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.88), 2-day mortality (adjusted OR = 1.31; 95% CI 1.04-1.67), and 3-day mortality (adjusted OR = 1.27; 95% CI 1.02-1.58). The EDOR was not significantly associated with 4- to 7-day mortalities and overall mortality at discharge. Conclusions The EDOR is associated with increased 1- to 3-day mortality even after controlling for potential confounders. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

Traditional forecasting models rely on rolling averages, vector auto-regression and auto-regressive integrated moving averages. On the other hand, deep learning and matrix factorization models have been recently proposed to tackle the same problem with more competitive performance. However, one major drawback of such models is that they tend to be overly complex in comparison to traditional techniques. In this paper, we report the results of prominent deep learning models with respect to a well-known machine learning baseline, a Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model. Similar to the deep neural network (DNN) models, we transform the time series forecasting task into a window-based regression problem. Furthermore, we feature-engineered the input and output structure of the GBRT model, such that, for each training window, the target values are concatenated with external features, and then flattened to form one input instance for a multi-output GBRT model. We conducted a comparative study on nine datasets for eight state-of-the-art deep-learning models that were presented at top-level conferences in the last years. The results demonstrate that the window-based input transformation boosts the performance of a simple GBRT model to levels that outperform all state-of-the-art DNN models evaluated in this paper.},

abstract = {While deep learning has enabled tremendous progress on text and image datasets, its superiority on tabular data is not clear. We contribute extensive benchmarks of standard and novel deep learning methods as well as tree-based models such as XGBoost and Random Forests, across a large number of datasets and hyperparameter combinations. We define a standard set of 45 datasets from varied domains with clear characteristics of tabular data and a benchmarking methodology accounting for both fitting models and finding good hyperparameters. Results show that tree-based models remain state-of-the-art on medium-sized data (∼10K samples) even without accounting for their superior speed. To understand this gap, we conduct an empirical investigation into the differing inductive biases of tree-based models and neural networks. This leads to a series of challenges which should guide researchers aiming to build tabular-specific neural network: 1. be robust to uninformative features, 2. preserve the orientation of the data, and 3. be able to easily learn irregular functions. To stimulate research on tabular architectures, we contribute a standard benchmark and raw data for baselines: every point of a 20 000 compute hours hyperparameter search for each learner.},

abstract = {Crowding in Emergency Departments (EDs) has emerged as a global public health crisis. Current literature has identified causes and the potential harms of crowding in recent years. The way crowding is measured has also been the source of emerging literature and debate. We aimed to synthesize the current literature of the causes, harms, and measures of crowding in emergency departments around the world. The review is guided by the current PRIOR statement, and involved Pubmed, Medline, and Embase searches for eligible systematic reviews. A risk of bias and quality assessment were performed for each review, and the results were synthesized into a narrative overview. A total of 13 systematic reviews were identified, each targeting the measures, causes, and harms of crowding in global emergency departments. Key among the results is that the measures of crowding were heterogeneous, even in geographically proximate areas, and that temporal measures are being utilized more frequently. It was identified that many measures are associated with crowding, and the literature would benefit from standardization of these metrics to promote improvement efforts and the generalization of research conclusions. The major causes of crowding were grouped into patient, staff, and system-level factors; with the most important factor identified as outpatient boarding. The harms of crowding, impacting patients, healthcare staff, and healthcare spending, highlight the importance of addressing crowding. This overview was intended to synthesize the current literature on crowding for relevant stakeholders, to assist with advocacy and solution-based decision making.},

abstract = {Emergency Departments (EDs) are the most overcrowded places in public hospitals. Machine learning can support decisions on effective ED resource management by accurately forecasting the number of ED visits. In addition, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques can help explain decisions from forecasting models and address challenges like lack of trust in machine learning results. The objective of this paper is to use machine learning and XAI to forecast and explain the ED visits on the next on duty day. Towards this end, a case study is presented that uses the XGBoost algorithm to create a model that forecasts the number of patient visits to the ED of the University Hospital of Ioannina in Greece, based on historical data from patient visits, time-based data, dates of holidays and special events, and weather data. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework is used to explain the model. The evaluation of the forecasting model resulted in an MAE value of 18.37, revealing a more accurate model than the baseline, with an MAE of 29.38. The number of patient visits is mostly affected by the day of the week of the on duty day, the mean number of visits in the previous four on duty days, and the maximum daily temperature. The results of this work can help policy makers in healthcare make more accurate and transparent decisions that increase the trust of people affected by them (e.g., medical staff).},

@article{Fan2022,
abstract = {Background: Emergency department (ED) overcrowding is a concerning global health care issue, which is mainly caused by the uncertainty of patient arrivals, especially during the pandemic. Accurate forecasting of patient arrivals can allow health resource allocation in advance to reduce overcrowding. Currently, traditional data, such as historical patient visits, weather, holiday, and calendar, are primarily used to create forecasting models. However, data from an internet search engine (eg, Google) is less studied, although they can provide pivotal real-time surveillance information. The internet data can be employed to improve forecasting performance and provide early warning, especially during the epidemic. Moreover, possible nonlinearities between patient arrivals and these variables are often ignored. Objective: This study aims to develop an intelligent forecasting system with machine learning models and internet search index to provide an accurate prediction of ED patient arrivals, to verify the effectiveness of the internet search index, and to explore whether nonlinear models can improve the forecasting accuracy. Methods: Data on ED patient arrivals were collected from July 12, 2009, to June 27, 2010, the period of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. These included 139,910 ED visits in our collaborative hospital, which is one of the biggest public hospitals in Hong Kong. Traditional data were also collected during the same period. The internet search index was generated from 268 search queries on Google to comprehensively capture the information about potential patients. The relationship between the index and patient arrivals was verified by Pearson correlation coefficient, Johansen cointegration, and Granger causality. Linear and nonlinear models were then developed with the internet search index to predict patient arrivals. The accuracy and robustness were also examined. Results: All models could accurately predict patient arrivals. The causality test indicated internet search index as a strong predictor of ED patient arrivals. With the internet search index, the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the root mean square error (RMSE) of the linear model reduced from 5.3% to 5.0% and from 24.44 to 23.18, respectively, whereas the MAPE and RMSE of the nonlinear model decreased even more, from 3.5% to 3% and from 16.72 to 14.55, respectively. Compared with each other, the experimental results revealed that the forecasting system with extreme learning machine, as well as the internet search index, had the best performance in both forecasting accuracy and robustness analysis. Conclusions: The proposed forecasting system can make accurate, real-time prediction of ED patient arrivals. Compared with the static traditional variables, the internet search index significantly improves forecasting as a reliable predictor monitoring continuous behavior trend and sudden changes during the epidemic (P = .002). The nonlinear model performs better than the linear counterparts by capturing the dynamic relationship between the index and patient arrivals. Thus, the system can facilitate staff planning and workflow monitoring.},

Objective: We explore whether past mean values and past observations are useful to forecast daily patient arrivals in an Emergency Department. Material and methods: We examine whether an integer-valued generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic (INGARCH) model can yield a better conditional distribution fit and forecast of patient arrivals by using past arrival information and taking into account the dynamics of the volatility of arrivals. Results: We document that INGARCH models improve both in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts, particularly in the lower and upper quantiles of the distribution of arrivals. Conclusion: Our results suggest that INGARCH modelling is a useful model for short-term and tactical emergency department planning, e.g., to assign rotas or locate staff for unexpected surges in patient arrivals.},

This study aimed to investigate whether the prognostic value of the NEWS at ED admission could be further improved by adding inflammatory blood markers (ie, white cell count (WCC), procalcitonin (PCT) and midregional-proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM). Design Secondary analysis of a multinational, observational study (TRIAGE study, March 2013-October 2014). Setting Three tertiary care centres in France, Switzerland and the USA. Participants A total of 1303 adult medical patients with complete NEWS data seeking ED care were included in the final analysis. NEWS was calculated retrospectively based on admission data. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was all-cause 30-day mortality. Secondary outcome was intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used multivariate regression analyses to investigate associations of NEWS and blood markers with outcomes and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) as a measure of discrimination. Results Of the 1303 included patients, 54 (4.1%) died within 30 days. The NEWS alone showed fair prognostic accuracy for all-cause 30-day mortality (AUC 0.73), with a multivariate adjusted OR of 1.26 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.40, p<0.001). The AUCs for the prediction of mortality using the inflammatory markers WCC, PCT and MR-proADM were 0.64, 0.71 and 0.78, respectively. Combining NEWS with all three blood markers or only with MR-proADM clearly improved discrimination with an AUC of 0.82 (p=0.002). Combining the three inflammatory markers with NEWS improved prediction of ICU admission (AUC 0.70vs0.65 when using NEWS alone, p=0.006). Conclusion NEWS is helpful in risk stratification of ED patients and can be further improved by the addition of inflammatory blood markers. Future studies should investigate whether risk stratification by NEWS in addition to biomarkers improve site-of-care decision in this patient population.

Clinical triage and risk assessment have become increasingly challenging due to the shortage of medical resources and the strain on hospital infrastructure caused by the pandemic. As a result of the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs), we now have access to a vast amount of clinical data, which allows us to develop prediction models and decision support systems to address these challenges. To date, there is no widely accepted clinical prediction benchmark related to the ED based on large-scale public EHRs. An open-source benchmark data platform would streamline research workflows by eliminating cumbersome data preprocessing, and facilitate comparisons among different studies and methodologies. Based on the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV Emergency Department (MIMIC-IV-ED) database, we created a benchmark dataset and proposed three clinical prediction benchmarks.

abstract = {Hospitals' Emergency Departments (ED) have a great relevance in the health of the population. Properly managing the ED department requires to optimise the service, while maintaining a high quality care. This trade-off implies to properly arrange the schedule for the personnel, so the service can duly attend all patients. In this regard, a key point is to know in advance how many patients will arrive to the service and the number that should be derived to hospitalisation. To provide such information, we present the results of applying different algorithms for forecasting ED admissions and hospitalisations for both seven days and four months ahead. To do this, we have employed the ED admissions and inpatients series from a Spanish civil and military hospital. The ED admissions have been aggregated on a daily basis and on the official workers' shifts, while the hospitalisations series have been considered daily. Over that data we employ two algorithms types: time series (AR, H-W, SARIMA and Prophet) and feature matrix (LR, EN, XGBoost and GLM). In addition, we create all possible ensembles among the models in order to find the best forecasting method. The findings of our study demonstrate that the ensembles can be beneficial in obtaining the best possible model.},

abstract = {This work is a case study intended to explore the capability of three forecasting techniques to predict emergency department (ED) visits based on Major Diagnostic Categories. It is a part of a larger work aimed to improve ED patients' throughput time. The ED in this case is considered as a part of the health chain and the process of arrival and departure of patients are included. The prediction models presented in this work are initially established and validated from the historical 3-year emergency room visits at Sherbrook University Hospitals and uses the week as the period unit. Given that resources are consumed differently for each disease, a group of patients has been considered according to the major diagnostic categories (MDC). Three predictive models of the number of visits are considered and compared: linear regression model, SARIMA and multivariate SARIMA. The accuracy of the prediction models is evaluated by calculating the mean percentage error (MAPE) and the mean absolute error (MAE) between forecast and observed data. The medium term forecasting model for the number of admissions is determined according to the estimated admission ratio for each patient group, while the short term model is established according to a regression model based on age groups. SARIMAX offers the most accurate model with a MAPE ranging from 6% to 49% (group of a small number of visits). Twelve of the twenty-seven groups of patients account for nearly 90% of the total of emergency room visits and the weighted mean average percentage error (WMAPE) stands at 8%. The admission rates for each group of patients is based on Gauss' distribution and is different from one group to another. For many MDCs, strong correlations can be demonstrated between the admission rates and the patient age groups by using a quadratic regression. The prediction models explored in this paper aims to help managers to plan more efficiently the emergency department resources. The models can also be used to plan resources of other hospital departments since they give information about the number of admitted patients for each MDC. {\textcopyright} 2015 EDP Sciences.},

@article{Susnjak2023,
abstract = {Urgent care clinics and emergency departments around the world periodically suffer from extended wait times beyond patient expectations due to surges in patient flows. The delays arising from inadequate staffing levels during these periods have been linked with adverse clinical outcomes. Previous research into forecasting patient flows has mostly used statistical techniques. These studies have also predominately focussed on short-term forecasts, which have limited practicality for the resourcing of medical personnel. This study joins an emerging body of work which seeks to explore the potential of machine learning algorithms to generate accurate forecasts of patient presentations. Our research uses datasets covering 10 years from two large urgent care clinics to develop long-term patient flow forecasts up to one quarter ahead using a range of state-of-the-art algorithms. A distinctive feature of this study is the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tools like Shapely and LIME that enable an in-depth analysis of the behaviour of the models, which would otherwise be uninterpretable. These analysis tools enabled us to explore the ability of the models to adapt to the volatility in patient demand during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns and to identify the most impactful variables, resulting in valuable insights into their performance. The results showed that a novel combination of advanced univariate models like Prophet as well as gradient boosting, into an ensemble, delivered the most accurate and consistent solutions on average. This approach generated improvements in the range of 16%–30% over the existing in-house methods for estimating the daily patient flows 90 days ahead.},

We follow more than 110,000 websites and their third-party HTTP requests for 12 months before and 6 months after the GDPR became effective and show that websites substantially re-duced their interactions with web technology providers. Importantly, this also holds for websites not legally bound by the GDPR. These changes are especially pronounced among less popular websites and regarding the collection of personal data. We document an increase in market concentration in web technology services after the introduction of the GDPR: Although all firms suffer losses, the largest vendor—Google—loses relatively less and significantly increases market share in important markets such as advertising and analytics. Our findings contribute to the discussion on how regulating privacy, artificial intelligence and other areas of data governance relate to data minimization, regulatory com-petition, and market structure.},

We study these questions using unique survey data of commercial AI startups. AI startups rely on data for their product development. Given the scale and scope of their business models, these startups are particularly susceptible to policy changes impacting data collection, storage and use. We find that training data and frequent model refreshes are particularly important for AI startups that rely on neural nets and ensemble learning algorithms. We also find that firms with customers in Europe are significantly more likely to create a new position to handle GDPR-related issues or to reallocate firm resources due to GDPR.

Four popular implementations, including original GBM algorithm and selected state-of-the-art gradient boosting frameworks (i.e. XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost), have been thoroughly compared on several publicly available real-world datasets of sufficient diversity. In the study, special emphasis was placed on hyperparameter optimization, specifically comparing two tuning strategies, i.e. randomized search and Bayesian optimization using the Tree-stuctured Parzen Estimator. The performance of considered methods was investigated in terms of common classification accuracy metrics as well as runtime and tuning time. Additionally, obtained results have been validated using appropriate statistical testing. An attempt was made to indicate a gradient boosting variant showing the right balance between effectiveness, reliability and ease of use.},

@article{Kadri2023,
   abstract = {Recently, the hospital systems face a high influx of patients generated by several events, such as seasonal flows or health crises related to epidemics (e.g., COVID’19). Despite the extent of the care demands, hospital establishments, particularly emergency departments (EDs), must admit patients for medical treatments. However, the high patient influx often increases patients’ length of stay (LOS) and leads to overcrowding problems within the EDs. To mitigate this issue, hospital managers need to predict the patient’s LOS, which is an essential indicator for assessing ED overcrowding and the use of the medical resources (allocation, planning, utilization rates). Thus, accurately predicting LOS is necessary to improve ED management. This paper proposes a deep learning-driven approach for predicting the patient LOS in ED using a generative adversarial network (GAN) model. The GAN-driven approach flexibly learns relevant information from linear and nonlinear processes without prior assumptions on data distribution and significantly enhances the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we classified the predicted patients’ LOS according to time spent at the pediatric emergency department (PED) to further help decision-making and prevent overcrowding. The experiments were conducted on actual data obtained from the PED in Lille regional hospital center, France. The GAN model results were compared with other deep learning models, including deep belief networks, convolutional neural network, stacked auto-encoder, and four machine learning models, namely support vector regression, random forests, adaboost, and decision tree. Results testify that deep learning models are suitable for predicting patient LOS and highlight GAN’s superior performance than the other models.},

   abstract = {A binary classification problem is common in medical field, and we often use sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, negative and positive predictive values as measures of performance of a binary predictor. In computer science, a classifier is usually evaluated with precision (positive predictive value) and recall (sensitivity). As a single summary measure of a classifier’s performance, F1 score, defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is widely used in the context of information retrieval and information extraction evaluation since it possesses favorable characteristics, especially when the prevalence is low. Some statistical methods for inference have been developed for the F1 score in binary classification problems; however, they have not been extended to the problem of multi-class classification. There are three types of F1 scores, and statistical properties of these F1 scores have hardly ever been discussed. We propose methods based on the large sample multivariate central limit theorem for estimating F1 scores with confidence intervals.},

   abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

True positive rate (TPR), also known as recall, measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified by the model.

\begin{equation}
\text{TPR} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
\end{equation}

True negative rate (TNR), also known as specificity, measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified by the model.

\begin{equation}
\text{TNR} = \frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN} + \text{FP}}
\end{equation}

Positive predictive value (PPV), also known as precision, measures the proportion of positive results that are true positives.

\begin{equation}
\text{PPV} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
\end{equation}

Negative predictive value (NPV) measures the proportion of negative results that are true negatives: 

\begin{equation}
\text{NPV} = \frac{\text{TN}}{\text{TN} + \text{FN}}
\end{equation}

False positive rate (FPR) measures the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly identified as positives by the model:

\begin{equation}
\text{FPR} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{FP} + \text{TN}}
\end{equation}

False negative rate (FNR) measures the proportion of actual positives that are incorrectly identified as negatives by the model.

\begin{equation}
    \text{FNR} = \frac{\text{FN}}{\text{FN} + \text{TP}}
\end{equation}
